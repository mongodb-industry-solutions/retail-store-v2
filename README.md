## Abstract

This repository contains a MongoDB-powered retail store demo designed to illustrate how MongoDB can enhance the modern e-commerce experience and can be easilly be integrated with modern technologies to enhance the shopping experience for the customer. The demo highlights various features that serve as a reference architecture for developers looking to integrate MongoDB into retail solutions.

Built with modern technologies, this demo is continuously evolving with new features added over time. Some features are developed in collaboration with [MongoDB partners](https://cloud.mongodb.com/ecosystem/) to create cutting-edge, scalable e-commerce solutions.

This README will guide you through the steps and prerequisites needed to replicate the demo in your own environment. Since some features require third-party services or specific configurations, the README is organized to help you focus on the features that interest you most. Each feature has its own dedicated section to guide you through the setup process, ensuring a smooth and streamlined experience.

## Overview

Customers have higher expectations than ever before, they expect seamless shopping experiences. To meet these evolving needs, retailers must work with modern flexible technologies that are able to scale and update as their requirements do. This demo includes key features that reflect the needs of a contemporary retail environment, such as AI-powered agentic chatbot, omnichannel ordering, and more. The demo integrates various technologies and services that work together to create a seamless shopping experience. MongoDB’s flexible, scalable, and performance-oriented data model supports the backend infrastructure.

In this demo, users will be able to explore how MongoDB optimizes data management and enhances system performance in a retail environment, while also facilitating the integration of AI technologies and systems—such as Dataworkz on the agentic RAG chatbot feature—by storing complex, rich data structures that merge operational and AI data. The solution serves as a practical guide for developers interested in implementing similar architectures in the retail industry, showing how MongoDB canbe leveraged to solve common challenges faced in modern e-commerce applications.
